;; During the simulation, services' status are updated on a
;; per 'tick' basis. On each update (tick), the lifetime of each service will
;; be reduced by 1. At the same time, the resource usage of each service will
;; be updated (the distribution on the resource usage follows a Beta
;; distribution).
;; In principle, each update of the resource usage should be in range
;; [0, ops/mem/net-cnf], i.e., it can't exceed the resources initially
;; configured (ops/mem/net-cnf) at the deployment time of the service,
;; neither a service can consume negative resources. However, it can become
;; complicated when multiple services are being deployed on the same server
;; at different times. For example, when Service-1 was 'SCHEDULED' to run
;; on Server-1 at Time-1, the required resources of Service-1 would first be
;; reserved on Server-1. When Service-1 arrives at Server-1, its resource
;; usage will be updated and, more importantly, the updated resource usage
;; would very likely be smaller than the initially configured resources.
;; If at Time-2 (e.g., after Service-1 has already started running on
;; Server-1), Service-2, had been scheduled to run on the same server
;; (Server-1), then during the scheduling process, the scheduler must
;; ensure that the Server-1 has sufficient resources for the deployment of
;; the Service-2, more specifically, this is determined by the condition:
;; (currently occupied resources of Server-1 + currently reserved resources of
;; Server-1 + the configured resources of Service-2) is greater or equal to
;; (the physically installed resources of Server-1).
;; In this equation, the 'currently occupied resources of Server-1' varies
;; from time to time. In this very specific example, it is only the current
;; resource usage of Service-1, since it is the only service running on the
;; server. If we further assume that (1) the total physical memory of
;; Server-1 is 2GB, (2) the current updated memory resource usage of
;; Service-1 is only a half of its requested memory (e.g., mem-now = 0.5,
;; mem-cnf = 1), and (3) the requested memory of Service-2 is 1.5GB (i.e.,
;; mem-cnf = 1.5). Based on the information assumed above, Server-1 would be
;; an eligible candidtate for the deployment of Service-2. When Service-2
;; starts running on Server-1,both services (Service 1 and 2) will update
;; their resource usage at the same time. Thus, it is possible when,
;; at Time-3, both services had updated their memory resource usage to
;; 1GB (Service-1) and 1.2GB (Service-2), respectively. However, the total
;; requested memory, at this moment, has exceeded the physical memory capacity
;; of Server-1. If this happens, the performance of the two
;; services will be degenerate. To compensate, both Service-1/2's
;; lifetime will be extended (i.e., requires more time to complete their
;; tasks). The aforementioned phenomenon will occur more frequently after
;; server consolidations are performed.

;;============================================================================;;
;; Consolidating servers in a datacenter to minimize the total power
;; consumption and to maximize the overall resource utilization.
;; The main mechanism used for server consolidation is live-migration. In
;; general, a live-migration can be performed easily for virtual machines or
;; containers. In this simulator, live-migrations are allowed for all virtual
;; machine, container, and bare-metal deployment of services.
;; Additionally, from a technical point of view, live-migration may only be
;; possible when processor architectures of the hosting server and
;; targeting server are compatible. However, in this version of the simulator,
;; migrations between heterogeneous processor architectures are allowed.
;; NOTE: migration of services shall start from over-utlized servers first,
;; then followed by under-utilized servers, due to the following reasons:
;;  1. it is more important to maintain servers' performance than
;;     saving energy or maximizing resource utilization;
;;  2. after migrating services off of the over-utilized servers, the number
;;     of under-utilized servers could be reduced, thus avoid unnecessary
;;     calculations. Note that service migraitons are expensive operations,
;;     in terms of service performance degeneration and large network bandwidth
;;     consumption.

## WHAT IS IT?

The simulation model was built for studying resource management in the clouds, focusing on how service placement strategies, service auto-migration, and server consolidation affect the overall performance of homogeneous and heterogeneous clouds, with regard to energy consumption, resource utilization, service-level agreement violation, and many other aspects that are important to cloud service providers and researchers.     


## HOW TO USE IT

### Global Configurations

"**_rack-space_**": The capacity of each server rack. The parameter determines how many servers can be installed in a rack.
RANGE: [8 - 36]; INCREMENT: [1]; DEFAULT: [12]

"**_total-racks_**": The total number of racks in the datacenter. In conjunction with the _rack-space_, the maximum number of servers can be determined by _rack-space_ * _total-racks_, maximized at 1296.
RANGE: [1 - 36]; INCREMENT: [1]; DEFAULT: [8]

"**_simulation-time-unit_**": This parameter specifies the unit of one 'tick', measured in miniute. For example, 5 indicates that every simulation _tick_ represents a 5 minutes time elapsed. More importantly, it implies that all status of the elements in the datacenter will be updated every 5 minutes. It can be configured from 1 minute to 24 hours (1440 minutes).
RANGE: [1 - 1440]; INCREMENT: [1]; DEFAULT: [5]

"**_total-services_**": A user can specify a number of services to be deployed in the datacenter. However, not all the services will be deployed at once. The number of services to be sent to the datacenter for deployment will be jointly determined with the _service-generation-speed_ parameter.
VALUE: [ POSITIVE INTEGER ]

"**_service-lifetime_**": Each service will have a lifetime randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution in the range specified here.
RANGE: [ MIN MAX ]

"**_rand-seed_**": To ensure the resutls from a simulation are reproducible, a random seed can be specified here. If the value of the random seed is greater than zero, the simulation result will be tied to the seed while keeping all other configurations intact. If the same seed was used in another run, the "same" results would be produced. However, to also allow randomness across multiple runs, the seed can be set to zero or a negative value, so that for each run, a pseudo-random seed will be used.
VALUE: [ INTEGER ]



### Service Configurations

"**_cpu-usage-dist_**", "**_mem-usage-dist_**", "**_net-usage-dist_**": For each service, three types of resources are considered, i.e., CPU, Memory and Network Bandwidth. At runtime, the usage of each type of resource will be drawn from a Beta distribution on a per 'tick' basis. This process will be performed for each individual service.    
RANGE: [ ALPHA BETA ]

"**_mem-access-ratio_**": This parameter determines how frequently the service's memory is being accessed. This is an important factor to be considered during service migration, as the size of the _busy_ memory (jointly with the available source-to-destination bandwidth) will influence speed of service migration. For each service, the ratio can be drawn from a given Beta distribution.
RANGE: [ ALPHA BETA ]

"**_service-generation-speed_**": It determines how many services will be generated in one simulation unit, i.e., how many concurrent services need to be deployed in the datacenter. It is an important factor for the evaluation of the efficiency of schedulers and placement algorithms in terms of scalability and speed. 
RANGE: [1 - 500]; INCREMENT: [5]; DEFAULT: [50]

"**_service-history-length_**": Each running service will cache a number of historical resource usage information (CPU, MEM, and NET). The values will be used for some advanced decision-making processes. A longer list may provide better forecast accuracy but slows down the simulation process.
VALUE: [ POSITIVE INTEGER ]

"**_service-submission-strategy_**": When a service is first created, it needs to be assigned a SCHEDULER. There are two strategies implemented in the simulation so far: _closest_ and _resource-pattern-matching_.

1. _closest_ strategy: a service will be assigned a SCHEDULER who is physically closest to it.

2. _resource-pattern-matching_ strategy: This is only applied to a datacenter that contains heterogeneous servers. In a heterogeneous cloud, servers have different configurations. The goal of this strategy is to maximize the overall resource utilization of the datacenter. Let R(a) denotes a tuple representing the three types of resource of a SERVICE, a; and R(s) denotes a tuple representing the available resources of the rack under the management of a SCHEDULER, s, the best match is determined by:
  [ min{ max{R(a)/R(s)} - min{R(a)/R(s)} } ]


"**_service-placement-algorithm_**": The service placement algorithms are the core in studying resource optimization in the cloud. There are currently five placement algorithms implemented: _random_, _first-fit_, _balanced-fit_, _max-utilization_, and _min-power_. Depending on the objectives set out for the cloud, algorithms shall be selected accordingly.

1. _random_: When a SERVICE has arrived at a SCHEDULER, the scheduler will find a random SERVER for the deployment of the service, with the following constraints: (1) the hosting server has sufficient resources for the service; (2) the deployment of the service will not make the server entering the "_OVERLOAD_" mode. Technically, a blind random placement is never encouraged in real environments, it is thus only provided as a baseline for comparison with other thoughtful algorithms.  

2. _first-fit_: the _first-fit) algorithm is one of the simplest algorithms used in resource optimization and application scheduling. The _first-fit_ in the simulator is a three-step process:
    (i)   _sort servers in the rack in an ascending order_
    (ii)  _place service(s) on the first server with sufficient resources in the list,     if the  server could not meet the conditions, move on to the next one in the list,     and so on._
    (iii) _if a server has been found, ask the service to move to the server, otherwise,         place the service back to the 'service submission zone'._  

3. _balanced_fit_: One of the important factors in measuring resource utilization is the resource fragmentation. In a cloud environment, servers often have different configurations, as well as services whose configurations vary largely depending on their types and/or user preferences. A careless placement might create small resource fragments that could not be used further. For instance, if two servers have the configurations Rc(s1) = {1000, 800, 100} and Rc(s2) = { 1000, 1000, 500}, i.e., the installed resources of the server (CPU, MEM and NET); and a service with the configuration Rc(a) = {500, 500, 100} to be deployed. If _a_ was deployed on _s1_, the remaining resources on _s1_ would be R'c(s1) = {500, 300, 0}; and for _s2_, R'c(s2) = {500, 500, 400}. Obviously, the former deployment makes _s1_ unavailable for future service placement as it has no bandwidth resources left. In comparison, the latter placement makes both the _s1_ and _s2_ available for future service deployment. The steps involved in the _balanced fit_ are outlined below:
    (i) _Since different types of resources are often measured in different units,     comparing different types of resources makes no sense. Comparing normalized             values or ratios would be reasonable. Furthermore, normalization can be             challenging as there is no single reference value across heterogeneous servers             and types of services. Thus, to calculate ratios, the resource tuples for the             service (requested resources) and candidate server (currently available             resources), Rc(a) and (Rc(s) - Ro(s)), need to be firstly collected. Note that Ro(.)     indicates the currently occupied resources._
    (ii)  _For each candidate server, calculate the ratios of the resources, i.e.,             Rc(a)/(Rc(s) - Ro(s))._
    (iii) _Identify the smallest distance between the ratios of the resources of all      the candidate servers, i.e., min{ max{ Rc(a)/(Rc(s) - Ro(s) } - min{ Rc(a)/(Rc(s) -         Ro(s) } }._
    (iv)  _Deploy the service on the server, which has the smallest resource distance,         otherwise, resubmit the service to the 'service submission zone' if no servers could be found._

4. _max-utilization_: This placement algorithm minimizes the residual resources of the server after the service deployment. I.e., given the physical and currently occupied resources of server, Rc(s) and Ro(s), and the requested resources from the service, Rc(a) that is to be deployed, the algorithm tries to find a server with minimum residual as follows:
min{ sum(1 - (Ro(s) + Rc(a))/Rc(s)) }, for all s in S.

5. _min-power_: This algorithm tries to place a service to a server so that the resulting placement will have a minimum increase of energy consumption in the datacenter.

"**_staged-evaluation_**": This parameter is used in conjunction with the _service-placement-algorithm_. When a scheduler evaluates servers for a service placement, it may find any servers in the rack (or datacenter) that can satisfy the resource requirements of the service, hence the 1-staged evaluation, or it can first evaluate all _active_ servers, i.e., the servers with status = _ON_, _READY_, or _IDLE_. If no satisfactory servers can be found, it will find a server with status = _OFF_. In this case, a fixed penalty point (the 'server-cold-start-delay') will be given to the service who is the first one using the server, hence the 2-staged evaluation. Lastly, a scheduler can also evaluate all the _running_ servers (i.e., status = _ON_ or _READY_) at first, then moves on to _IDLE_ servers (i.e., status = _IDLE_), and lastly tries with the _OFF_ servers, hence the 3-staged evaluation.



### Scheduler Configurations

"**_scheduler-queue-capacity_**": Each scheduler has its capacity specified by the parameter. It is reserved to study queuing effects in the cloud. 
RANGE: [10 - 100]; INCREMENT: [1]; DEFAULT: [50]

"**_scheduler-history-length_**": This value indicates how much historical information a scheduler will cache, so that some decisions could be made based on the statistics collected here. Caching more information, i.e., the CPU, MEM and NET usage, can potentially support a more accurate decision making, but on the other hand, it may slow down the simulation significantly and result in a much bigger memory footprint.
RANG: [0, 200]; INCREMENT: [5]; DEFAULT; [5]

"**_server-standby-strategy_**": A SCHEDULER is responsible for managing servers in the rack. A scheduler decides when a server should be switched off to save energy or switched on for an upcoming service deployment. The current implementation maintains a fixed number of standby servers, _all-on_ or _all-off_. Adaptive strategies are still in the TO-DO list.




### Server Configurations

"**_server-cpu-utilization-threadhold_**", "**_server-mem-utilization-threadhold_**", "**_server-net-utilization-threadhold_**": These parameters specify the under-utilization and over-utilization thresholds, which will be used for determining whether a server consolidation and/or an auto-migration process will be triggered.

"**_server-model_**": In general, different models of servers may have different default OEM configurations and energy consumption patterns. To simulate a heterogeneous datacenter environment, several pre-built servers (coded from 0 to 8) can be selected. The model of the server can be specified in the _server-model_ global variable. For example, using servers of Model 1, 2, 3 in the simulation can be specified as: [1 2 3]. The detailed server specifications and their associated code can be found in the **Server Specifications** section.

"**_datacenter-level-heterogeneity?_**": This switch indicates whether multiple server models will be allowed in the cloud. If it's switched off, the default server (coded 1) will be used, regardless of the servers specified in the _server-model_. If a specific server is needed in the simulation, enable this parameter and specify the specific server in the _server_model_. For example, if the cloud contains only the Dell PowerEdge R6515 servers, this can be configured as: _datacenter-level-heterogeneity? = ON_ and _server-model = [6]_.

"**_rack-level-heterogeneity?_**": If this switch is on and the _server-model_ contains multiple servers, each rack will contain servers with different configurations. This switch only works when the _datacenter-level-heterogeneity?_ is switched on.

"**_consolidation?_**": This switch tells the simulator whether under-utilized servers should be consolidated, i.e., migrate all services out of the servers, so that the server can be switched off to save energy.

"**_consolidation-interval_**": Consolidation is an expensive process. It is not recommended to perform server consolidation frequently. Each tick in this sliding bar indicates a 'simulation-time-unit'.
RANGE: [1 - 1440]; INCREMENT: [1]; DEFAULT: [12]

"**_server-consolidation-strategy_**": When trying to consolidate a server, all services will be migrated out or not at all. When migrating services out of a server, target servers must first be identified. The target server can be a server in the same rack (_within-rack_) or on other racks in the datacenter (_within-datacenter_). Technically, migrating within a rack would be preferred as the network traffic would be kept local. On the other side, there may not be many servers that can be used in the rack. It is about balancing between better optimization and minimizing burden on cloud network.


"**_power-estimation-method_**": This parameter is mainly used with the _min-power_ placement algorithm. It is used to estimate energy consumption of a server if a given service was placed on it. The estimation can be based on the following statistics:

1. _max_: The max _ops_ value the service has experienced in its cached history.
2. _mean_: The average _ops_ of the service in its cached history.
3. _median_: The median _ops_ of the service in its cached history.
4. _configured_: The initially configured _ops_ of the service, i.e., 'ops-cnf'.
5. _linear-regression_: Reserved


"**_show-migr-move?_**": If enabled, service migration movement will be displayed. This visualization will not affect the accuracy of any calculations. The moving objects are a different breed of agents that only for visualization purpose. 

"**_auto-migration?_**: When a server enters the _OVERLOAD_ mode, the server will migrate some services out automatically, if this switch is enabled.  

"**_auto-migration-strategy_**": When migrating services out of a server due to over-utilization, it is only necessary to migrate some services out until the server is back to a _normal_ status. Thus, which services should be migrated depends on the objectives of the system. In the simulation, two strategies have been implemented:

1. _least migration time_: A service migration time is generally determined by the P2P network bandwidth, memory footprint, and _memory dirtying rate_ (i.e., how frequent the service's memory is being accessed). The preference list for services to be migrated out is a list of services sorted in ascending order according the values in the above factors. The service in the first place of the list will be migrated out. If the server is still over-utilized, then the second service will be moved out, so on and so forth.

2. _leas migration number_: In this case, the service with the most aggressive resource demand will be migrated out first.


"**_power-model-method_**: As mentioned above, servers with different specifications may exhabit different patterns of energy consumption. Thus, we need to build an energy consumption model for each _model_ of servers. Additionally, to evaluate the accuracy of different models, a _stepwise-simple-linear-regression_, _simple_linear_regression_, _Quadratic_Polynomial_, and _Cubic-Polynomial_ energy consumption models have been built for each _model_ of servers, based on the data collected from spac.org. The accuracy and other statistics associated with the models can be found in the publication.
